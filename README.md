# Open Ended Capstone Step 4
This repository is the fourth step in the capstone which contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) on capstone data sets.

EDA steps are conducted using Jupyter Notebooks.

### NEXRAD EDA
    This Jupyter notebook consists of exploratory data analysis of the NEXRAD dataset. The EDA takes several different approaches to accessing the NEXRAD data using several different Python modules, libraries, and packages.
    
#### Installation
    For the NEXRAD EDA, in terminal run the following commands:
    - run `!conda install --yes cartopy` for catopy
    - run `pip install nexradaws`
    - run `pip install boto3`
    - run `pip install metpy`
    - run `pip install boto3`
    - run `pip install numpy`
    

Multiple datasets are included in this project, including both archived and streaming NEXRAD Weather Analysis Datasets, as well as live and archived Twitter feed.
